## 2. Development Workflow

### Run the Firestore Emulator + Tests

FireODM uses the Firebase Emulator for integration tests. Simply run:

### Building the Library

To compile TypeScript into JavaScript and generate type definitions:

```bash
npm run build
```

Your output will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Linting & Formatting

We enforce code style with ESLint and Prettier. To check:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix issues:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
```
